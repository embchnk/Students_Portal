# Introduction

*We wanted to create a page where **students** will be able to **share** their own **recipes**. Our **aim** was to make
that page look **clear** and **readable**.*

*So, we made a page where all **variables** included in recipe are **divided**. There are **separated** fields for: ingredients,
instructions, title, photo and author. Thanks to it recipes on our page are **easier to read**.*
